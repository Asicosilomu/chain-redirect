			<h1>Chain Redirect</h1>
			<p>By clicking the link below, you will be redirected to a page which redirects to another page which redirects back to the other page which redirects back to it and so on... See how much your browser can survive!</p>
			<p>Also, as many of the scummy bastards out there used this trick to block the back button, browsers have patched it. So now two clicks of the back button will get you back.</p>
